# clink
This is a url link checking bot. 

When a user posts a url in the discord server , the bot checks if the url has a valid domain , a valid domain is any url which is allowed by the admin.
If it finds a invalid link , It deletes the post and assigns an ID for further purpose. 
If a user feels the he/she posted a valid url , he can request the moderators or admins of the server to validate the url with the help of ID.
Once the url is validated and the admin/mod feels it is valid they can approve the url with ID.
Once approved, the url will be added to valid domains.

you can access the bot help using ' clink.help '
